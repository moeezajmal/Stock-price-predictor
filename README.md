### **Repository Name**: Stock Price Predictor

### **Description:**
This project provides a simple stock price predictor using historical stock data and a linear regression model. The tool downloads stock data from Yahoo Finance, prepares the data, trains the model, and predicts future stock prices. A graphical representation of the predicted prices vs. actual prices is also provided.

### **Key Features:**

- **Stock Data Retrieval:** Pulls historical data using Yahoo Finance's API.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Uses machine learning to predict future stock prices based on past trends.
- **Visualization:** Displays a comparison of predicted stock prices against actual prices for easy interpretation.
- **Customizable:** Users can input their own stock ticker symbols to generate predictions for different stocks.

### **How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Install the required dependencies using:
 `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the script using:
4. `python stock_predictor.py`
5. Enter the stock ticker symbol when prompted (e.g., AAPL, MSFT, etc.).
6. View the graph comparing the predicted prices to the actual prices.

### **Future Improvements:**

- Implement more advanced models like LSTM or ARIMA.
- Add functionality for real-time stock data predictions.
- Improve the accuracy by including additional features like trading volume, technical indicators, etc.
